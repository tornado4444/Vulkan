# My first triangle on Vulkan!
Here is my first triangle on Vulkan(Arch Linux). I took most of the information from the source: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/.
I also looked for additional information on websites Khronos, to learn more information about Linux. 

# How to build!
My project was implemented exclusively for those who are on Linux, so if you want to build the project, enter the following commands:

```
git clone 
```
